<!-- 📝 Welcome to the PICO-8 Web! -->

## 🎮 Welcome to the Future of Retro

Remember the early days of the web? When every site had a visitor counter, animated GIFs, and that unmistakable "under construction" banner? Those were simpler times, when creativity flourished within constraints and every pixel mattered.

The **Neocities Revival** theme brings back that nostalgic magic, enhanced with the beautiful design philosophy of PICO-8's fantasy console.

## 🌈 The PICO-8 Difference

PICO-8 isn't just a game engine—it's a design philosophy. With only 16 colors and strict limitations, it forces creators to focus on what truly matters: **clarity, creativity, and charm**.

{{< p8-info >}}
**Fun Fact**: PICO-8's 16-color palette was carefully chosen to work harmoniously together, making it nearly impossible to create ugly color combinations!

- 🌲 **Dark Green** (`#008751`) - Nature and growth
- 🍂 **Brown** (`#ab5236`) - Warmth and earth
- 🪨 **Dark Grey** (`#5f574f`) - Stability

## 🚀 Modern Features, Retro Soul

This isn't just about nostalgia—it's about bringing the best of both worlds together:

{{< p8-code lang="css" >}}
/* Modern CSS with retro constraints */
.p8-button {
  background: var(--p8-blue);
  color: var(--p8-white);
  border: 2px solid var(--p8-dark-blue);
  font-family: 'Pixel Font', monospace;
