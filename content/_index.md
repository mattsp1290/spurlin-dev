## 🌟 The Fantasy Console Philosophy

> *"Fantasy consoles are like the demoscene, but more accessible. They're about embracing constraints to foster creativity."*

TIC-80 proves that **240×136 pixels** and **16 colors** are enough to create entire worlds. This website applies that same philosophy to web development, showing how constraints can lead to more thoughtful, intentional design.
